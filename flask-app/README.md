# Ticket Management Slack Bot

This Flask app is a Slack bot designed to manage tickets within a Slack workspace. It allows users to submit new tickets via a Slack modal, assign tickets to system users, update ticket statuses, and post ticket details to a designated Slack channel. The app uses a PostgreSQL database to store ticket information and comments.

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set for the app to function correctly:

- **`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`**: The token for your Slack bot. Obtain this from your Slack app's settings.
- **`DATABASE_URL`**: The connection string for your PostgreSQL database. On Railway, this will be provided when you provision a PostgreSQL database.
- **`ADMIN_CHANNEL`**: The Slack channel where error notifications will be posted (e.g., `#admin-notifications`).
- **`TIMEZONE`**: Your preferred timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`).
- **`SYSTEM_USERS`**: A comma-separated list of Slack user IDs who have system privileges (e.g., `U12345678,U87654321`).

On Railway, set these variables in your project's environment settings.

### Database Setup

The app includes an `init_db()` function that creates the necessary database tables. After setting up the database connection, this function is called automatically to initialize the schema.
